When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  - I would want ot use a remote repository if I'd like to show/share/
  let others collaborate on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- pulling a repository will check(out) it out.
	I don't want that happen while I'm working on it !

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	- branches : a separate track of commits. Use to separate experimental
	features, prod branch (master), pre-pro branch (staged ?) and others versions.
	- clones : a copy of a reposotory. No link at all to it.
	I'd use clone for a project unrelated to the original one, if just want to download it
	to see/use a part or i I don't want to be linked to it
	- forks : a clone linked to the original one by github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	- you can merge your head (and resolve conflicts) with the remote head before pushing
