When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  - I would want ot use a remote repository if I'd like to show/share/
  let others collaborate on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- pulling a repository will check(out) it out.
	I don't want that happen while I'm working on it !

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	- branches : a separate track of commits. Use to separate experimental
	features, prod branch (master), pre-pro branch (staged ?) and others versions.
	- clones : a copy of a reposotory. No link at all to it.
	I'd use clone for a project unrelated to the original one, if just want to download it
	to see/use a part or if I don't want to be linked to it
	- forks : a clone linked to the original one by github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	- you can merge your head (and resolve conflicts) with the remote head before pushing

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
	- Github makes it easier to collaborate on the same projects :
		- branches helps to work on differents features and merge them when ready
		- master branch keeps everyone up to date
		- log of commits gives quick info of what's the changes made by others
		- pull requests gives a space to discuss about merging files with tools like
		line-comments, reviews and integrated commits.
	- however, I can't say Github is evident at the first place. So If I'd like to
	make a quick work with someone that doesn't know it, I have to explain him how it works,
	to help him to use it or to work with him in another way (like sending files with
	email/dropbox and talking over email/chat)

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
